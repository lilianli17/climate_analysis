# Global Climate Change Analysis

## Motivation
Considering the increasing frequency of abnormal weather patterns in the past yearsâ€”hurricanes, wildfires, floods, heatwaves, etc., we believe that a thorough and detailed analysis on world's temperature data would illustrate the severity of the issue at hand and serve great value to the public.

In this project, we take comprehensive climate trends data from Berkeley Earch, which contains temperature reports across the globe from 1750 to 2015, and develop various predictive machine learning models to forecast future temperatures.
